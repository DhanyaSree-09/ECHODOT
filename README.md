📝 Project Description:

ECHODOT is an innovative assistive technology solution that bridges the communication gap between the visually impaired and sighted individuals.
The system allows users to upload an image containing Braille text, which is then automatically recognized, translated into English, and converted into speech output.

The main goal of ECHODOT is to make Braille content digitally accessible for everyone — especially for teachers, volunteers, and caregivers who work with visually challenged learners.
Unlike traditional systems that rely on physical Braille embossers or manual translation, ECHODOT provides a low-cost, AI-powered digital tool that instantly interprets Braille from images.

⚙️ Key Features:

📸 Upload or capture Braille images for translation

🔍 Detect and interpret Braille dot patterns using image processing

💬 Translate Braille to readable English text

🔊 Convert translated text to speech output

🌐 Simple, intuitive user interface for accessibility

💻 Technologies Used:
Technology	Purpose / Usage
Python	Core programming language for the entire project
OpenCV	For image processing and Braille dot detection
NumPy	Used for mathematical operations and image array manipulation
Pillow (PIL)	For image handling and enhancement
Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS)	Converts translated text into human-like voice output
Streamlit / Flask	Builds the interactive user interface (web-based or local)
Machine Learning (Optional)	For advanced Braille recognition using pattern classification
🌍 Impact:

ECHODOT helps non-Braille readers understand Braille content and supports visually impaired individuals by giving them access to real-time speech feedback.
It promotes digital inclusivity, education accessibility, and assistive AI innovation.

Dots are mapped to English characters using Braille mapping logic.

Text is generated and converted into speech output.
